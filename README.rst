Library for interfacing with the BasicMicro Roboclaw 2x7A motor controller
==========================================================================

This is a simple C++ library to interface with the dual `Roboclaw 2x7A`_ motion
controller.

This library is written using C++17 and thus requires a relatively recent C++ compiler
(I've tested it with GCC 7).

It is fully integrated with the Hunter_ package manager, but can also be built as a
standalone package. The build system uses CMake.
